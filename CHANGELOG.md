##2015-11-29 - Release 1.2.1
###Summary

Setting up a site from scratch will no longer fail the Puppet run
([issue #3](https://github.com/tohuwabohu/puppet-drupal/issues/3)). The pending database updates are now only applied
if the site has been fully set up.

Puppet-specific limitations caused by the usage of the archive module have been documented as well
([issue #4](https://github.com/tohuwabohu/puppet-drupal/issues/4)).
